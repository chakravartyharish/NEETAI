# Prompt optimization
@neet-ai-specialist *optimize-prompts

# Model evaluation
@neet-ai-specialist *evaluate-models "gpt-4o vs gpt-4o-mini performance"
```

### **5. Document Generation and Management**

#### **PRD Generation:**
```bash
# Generate feature PRD
@edtech-product-manager *create-prd "mobile-offline-learning"

# Update existing PRD
@pm "Update PRD with user feedback from beta testing"
```

#### **Architecture Documentation:**
```bash
# System design
@architect "Design real-time collaborative study groups feature"

# Update technical docs
@architect *update-docs
```

#### **Story Management:**
```bash
# Create new story
@pm "Create story for AR question scanning feature"

# Review and validate story
@po "Validate story against PRD and architecture requirements"
```
