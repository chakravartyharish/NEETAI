# Sample NEET Chemistry Questions - Organic Chemistry

## Question 1: Aldehydes and Ketones
**Question**: Which of the following compounds will give a positive iodoform test?
A) CH₃CHO  
B) CH₃COCH₃  
C) HCHO  
D) Both A and B

**Correct Answer**: D) Both A and B

**Explanation**: 
The iodoform test is given by compounds containing the methyl ketone group (CH₃CO-) or compounds that can be oxidized to methyl ketones. Acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO) and acetone (CH₃COCH₃) both contain or can form the required structural unit.

## Question 2: Chemical Bonding
**Question**: The bond angle in ammonia (NH₃) is approximately:
A) 90°
B) 104.5°
C) 107°
D) 120°

**Correct Answer**: C) 107°

**Explanation**: 
Due to the presence of one lone pair of electrons on nitrogen, the bond angle in ammonia is less than the tetrahedral angle (109.5°) and is approximately 107°.

## Question 3: Thermodynamics
**Question**: For which of the following processes, ΔS is negative?
A) Sublimation of dry ice
B) Synthesis of ammonia from N₂ and H₂  
C) Dissolving sugar in water
D) Melting of ice

**Correct Answer**: B) Synthesis of ammonia from N₂ and H₂

**Explanation**:
N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃
In this reaction, 4 moles of gaseous reactants form 2 moles of gaseous products, resulting in a decrease in entropy (ΔS < 0).
