## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Agent Communication Issues

**Problem**: Agents not responding to messages
**Symptoms**: Timeout errors, workflow failures
**Diagnosis**: Check message queue health, network connectivity
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check message queue status
kubectl get pods -l app=rabbitmq
kubectl logs -f deployment/rabbitmq

# Restart message queue if needed
kubectl rollout restart deployment/rabbitmq

# Verify agent connectivity
kubectl exec -it agent-pod -- curl http://target-agent:8080/health
```

#### Performance Degradation

**Problem**: Slow response times, high latency
**Symptoms**: API responses >2 seconds, user complaints
**Diagnosis**: Check system metrics, database performance
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check system metrics
kubectl top pods
kubectl top nodes

# Check database performance
kubectl exec -it postgres-primary-0 -- pg_stat_activity

# Scale up if needed
kubectl scale deployment ai-ml-agent --replicas=5
```

#### Database Connection Issues

**Problem**: Database connection failures
**Symptoms**: Connection timeout errors, application crashes
**Diagnosis**: Check connection pool, database health
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check database status
kubectl get pods -l app=postgresql

# Check connection pool status
kubectl logs -f deployment/pgbouncer

# Restart database connections
kubectl rollout restart deployment/pgbouncer
```

### Diagnostic Commands

**System Health Check**:
```bash
# Overall system status
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get services
kubectl get ingress

# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods --sort-by=memory
kubectl describe nodes

# Check persistent volumes
kubectl get pv,pvc
```

**Application Debugging**:
```bash
# Check application logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/agent-name --tail=100

# Debug networking issues
kubectl exec -it agent-pod -- nslookup target-service
kubectl exec -it agent-pod -- ping target-service

# Check configuration
kubectl get configmap agent-config -o yaml
kubectl get secret agent-secrets -o yaml
```

**Performance Analysis**:
```bash
# Check metrics
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80

# Analyze traces
kubectl port-forward svc/jaeger 16686:16686

# Check logs
kubectl port-forward svc/kibana 5601:5601
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### Service Recovery

**Steps for service restoration**:
1. Identify the affected service
2. Check service logs for error patterns
3. Verify configuration and secrets
4. Restart the service if necessary
5. Monitor service health and performance
6. Scale up if performance issues persist

#### Data Recovery

**Database Recovery Process**:
1. Stop write operations to prevent data corruption
2. Assess the extent of data loss or corruption
3. Restore from the most recent backup
4. Apply transaction logs since backup
5. Verify data integrity and consistency
6. Resume normal operations

#### Disaster Recovery

**Full System Recovery**:
1. Activate disaster recovery site
2. Restore all services from backups
3. Update DNS to point to recovery site
4. Verify all services are operational
5. Communicate status to users
6. Plan for failback to primary site
