## Sample Question Generation

**Topic Requested**: "Physics - Modern Physics - Photoelectric Effect"

### Generated Questions:

#### Question 1: Einstein's Photoelectric Equation
**Question**: The work function of a metal is 2.5 eV. If light of wavelength 400 nm is incident on the metal surface, the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons will be:
(Given: h = 6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s, c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s, 1 eV = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ J)

A) 0.6 eV
B) 0.8 eV  
C) 1.1 eV
D) 1.6 eV

**Solution**: 
Energy of photon = hc/λ = (6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ × 3 × 10⁸)/(400 × 10⁻⁹) = 4.97 × 10⁻¹⁹ J = 3.1 eV
Maximum KE = E - φ₀ = 3.1 - 2.5 = 0.6 eV

**Answer**: A) 0.6 eV

#### Question 2: Threshold Frequency
**Question**: For a photoelectric cell, the stopping potential is 2V when illuminated with light of wavelength 300 nm. The threshold wavelength for the material is:

A) 450 nm
B) 500 nm
C) 600 nm  
D) 650 nm

**NEET Pattern Analysis**:
- Numerical calculation based on photoelectric equation
- Tests understanding of threshold concepts
- Similar to NEET 2019, 2021 questions
- Difficulty: Medium
