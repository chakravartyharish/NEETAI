# Build Sequence Summary

## Priority Order

1. **Phase 1**: Foundation – Monorepo, core packages, basic web app.
2. **Phase 2**: Core Learning – AI, questions, quizzes.
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced – Voice, AR, social.
4. **Phase 4**: Enterprise – Admin, analytics, payments.
5. **Phase 5**: Scaling – Performance, caching, real-time.
6. **Phase 6**: Production – Deployment, monitoring.

## Key Dependencies

- Core packages before apps.
- Database schema early.
- AI depends on caching.
- Real-time requires core stability.
- Deployment needs monitoring.

This architecture provides a scalable foundation leveraging Vercel and Supabase. If you need code expansions, deployments, or modifications, let me know.[^3]
