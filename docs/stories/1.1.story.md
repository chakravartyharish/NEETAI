# Story: User Authentication System

**Story ID**: 1.1  
**Epic**: Core Learning Engine (Foundation)  
**Sprint**: 1  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Points**: 8  
**Status**: Review

## User Story

**As a** student preparing for NEET  
**I want** to create an account and securely log in  
**So that** I can access personalized features and track my progress

## Context & Background

This story establishes the foundation for user management across the entire NEET Prep AI Platform. It's critical for Epic 1 as all subsequent learning features depend on proper user identification and authorization.

### Related Architecture Components:
- `packages/auth` - Authentication utilities and hooks
- `packages/database` - User data management
- `apps/web/app/(auth)` - Authentication UI components
- Supabase Auth service integration

### Educational Considerations:
- Multi-role support (student, coach, parent, admin)
- Progress tracking foundation
- Personalization data collection
- Social features preparation

## Dev Notes
