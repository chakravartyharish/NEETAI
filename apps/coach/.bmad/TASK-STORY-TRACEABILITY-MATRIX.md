## 📋 **Acceptance Criteria Mapping**

### **Story AC to Task Deliverable Mapping**
Each story's acceptance criteria must map to specific task deliverables:

**Example: STORY-01-02 (Institute Verification)**
- AC-01: Admin Review Dashboard → TASK-01-06 (Backend) + TASK-01-07 (Frontend)
- AC-02: Document Validation → TASK-01-06 (Backend validation logic)
- AC-03: Email Notifications → TASK-01-06 (Email service integration)
- AC-04: Status Tracking → TASK-01-07 (UI status components)
- AC-05: Audit Trail → TASK-01-08 (Integration testing & audit logging)
