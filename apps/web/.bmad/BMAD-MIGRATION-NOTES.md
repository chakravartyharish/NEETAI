## Directory Changes

### Old Structure (Moved to Backup):
```
tasks-old-traditional/
â”œâ”€â”€ epic-01-authentication-onboarding/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TASK-001-multi-provider-user-registration.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TASK-002-secure-user-authentication.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ TASK-003-account-recovery-system.md
â”œâ”€â”€ epic-02-ai-learning-engine/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ TASK-012-intelligent-question-explanations.md
â””â”€â”€ [sparse coverage - only 7 tasks]
```

### New BMAD Structure:
```
tasks/
â”œâ”€â”€ epic-01-authentication-onboarding/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WEB-001-ANALYZE-001.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WEB-001-BUILD-001.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WEB-001-BUILD-002.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WEB-001-MEASURE-001.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WEB-001-DEPLOY-001.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [15 tasks total - 3 stories Ã— 5 BMAD phases]
â”œâ”€â”€ epic-02-ai-learning-engine/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [20 tasks total - 4 stories Ã— 5 BMAD phases]
â””â”€â”€ [all 8 epics with complete coverage]
```

## BMAD Task Structure

Each story now has exactly 5 BMAD tasks:

1. **WEB-XXX-ANALYZE-001**: Monitoring and optimization setup
2. **WEB-XXX-BUILD-001**: Design and planning phase
3. **WEB-XXX-BUILD-002**: Core implementation phase
4. **WEB-XXX-MEASURE-001**: Testing and validation phase
5. **WEB-XXX-DEPLOY-001**: Production deployment phase

## Benefits Achieved

âœ… **BMAD Methodology Compliance**: Consistent with admin app excellence  
âœ… **Systematic Development**: Structured approach for all features  
âœ… **Development Readiness**: All epics now ready for systematic development

## Backup Information

The original traditional tasks have been preserved in:
- **Location**: `/home/harish/Desktop/NEETAI/apps/web/.bmad/tasks-old-traditional/`
- **Content**: 7 traditional tasks from partial implementation
- **Purpose**: Reference and historical record
